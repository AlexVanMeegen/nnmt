Here you find some useful routines, primarily for usage within the toolbox.

The submodule :mod:`nnmt.input_output` contains a wrapper of the ``h5py``
package, allowing to store dictionaries as ``h5`` files and to load them again.

The submodule :mod:`nnmt.utils` contains functions for unit conversion, several
parameter checks, and the function used for caching the results when using the
model workflow.
